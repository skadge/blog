Talk at ERF2013: From Semantic Web to Robot Cognition
=====================================================

I've been invited by `Markus Waibel <http://mwaibel.info/>`_ to give a talk at
the `European Robotic Forum 2013 <http://www.eurobotics2013.com/>`_, in Lyon on
the 20th of March.

Markus organizes a `workshop on Cloud Robotics
<http://www.roboearth.org/eurobotics2013>`_ and I'll be talking about the
application to robots of technologies originally built for the Semantic Web.
